Title: Add constraint validation, solver-timeout docs, single-case runner, and tests

Summary
-------
This PR introduces post-solve constraint validation for Pyomo benchmark runs, a lightweight
single-case runner to debug individual parameter combinations, documentation of the IPOPT
timeout semantics, a Future Work roadmap, and unit tests for the new validation and adapter
behavior. The changes are scoped to benchmarking utilities and do not modify core physics.

Key Changes
-----------
- benchmarks/scripts/validate.py: Added `validate_constraints()` to check dryness, product
  temperature, and ramp-rate constraints and return detailed violation metrics.
- benchmarks/scripts/run_single_case.py: New utility to run one scipy baseline + one Pyomo run
  with full terminal output for debugging (supports `--tee`, `--solver-timeout`, ramp overrides).
- benchmarks/src/adapters.py: Ensure CLI ramp overrides are applied before extracting
  `ramp_constraints` metadata; pass `solver_timeout` through to optimizers.
- lyopronto/pyomo_models/optimizers.py: Add `solver_timeout` parameter usage; set IPOPT
  `max_cpu_time` (CPU seconds). Note: IPOPT <=3.13 does not support `max_wall_time`.
- benchmarks/notebooks/grid_analysis_SIMPLE.ipynb: Add JSONL v2 schema explanation and an
  aggregated constraint-metrics summary cell for analysis convenience.
- docs/FUTURE_WORK.md: Roadmap capturing next steps (wall-time guard, logging refactor, tests).
- tests/test_benchmarks_validate.py: New unit tests for `validate_constraints` and adapter ramp
  override logic.
- .gitignore: Ignore generated benchmark artifacts under `benchmarks/results/`.

Why
---
Earlier cases showed that Pyomo solvers reported success even when constraints (drying target or
ramp limits) were violated; this PR fixes that by validating trajectories post-solve and marking
failed runs appropriately in analysis. It also supplies developer tooling to reproduce and
diagnose problematic parameter combinations faster.

Testing / Validation Steps
-------------------------
Local (quick):

```bash
conda activate lyopronto
pytest tests/test_benchmarks_validate.py -q
pytest tests -q  # full suite (takes ~5 minutes)
```

Manual scenario reproduction:

```bash
# Run a single-case debug with verbose IPOPT output
python benchmarks/scripts/run_single_case.py \
  --task both --R0 0.4 --A1 20 --method fd --n-elements 1000 \
  --ramp-Tsh-max 40 --ramp-Pch-max 0.05 --solver-timeout 180 --tee
```

Review Checklist
----------------
- [ ] Code compiles and tests pass (CI will run full suite)
- [ ] Confirm `validate_constraints` metrics are included in JSONL output when running
      `grid_cli.py generate ...` (this is done by `grid_cli` integration)
- [ ] Documentation updated: README and notebook reflect behavior and schema
- [ ] Decide fate of legacy benchmark scripts deleted from repo (separate cleanup PR recommended)

Risks and Notes
---------------
- IPOPT `max_cpu_time` limits CPU time, not wall-clock time. Upgrading to IPOPT 3.14 enables
  `max_wall_time`. For environments where wall time is essential, use a process-level wrapper
  (e.g., `timeout`) or upgrade the solver.
- Staged solve prints can be noisy; consider centralizing logging behind a verbosity flag.
